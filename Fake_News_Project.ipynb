       "       ['EXCLUSIVE: Trump Has ’Less Kinetic’ Option in Afghanistan',\n",
       "        'Kristina Wong',\n",
       "        'President Donald Trump is deciding between two rival ideas  —   one more “kinetic” and the other “less kinetic”  —   for U. S. strategy in Afghanistan, according to a senior White House official. [On one side are the military strategists, who favor a robust U. S. military approach to resolving the    Afghanistan war  —   hitting the Taliban harder and pressuring them back to the negotiating table. It would also include more spending on building the Afghan government’s capacity, and entail more overall funding, troops, and resources.  On the other side are those who want to maintain the current level of troops but limit U. S. involvement in the war. That option would leave it up to the Afghan government and the Taliban to resolve the conflict, but assist the Afghan government with a minimal    mission, also known as “foreign internal defense,” and assist local partners in fighting extremist ideology. It would also include a counterterrorism presence to target   targets. It would take notably longer than the kinetic plan but would be significantly cheaper. “We don’t fight other people’s wars,” the official said. “We help our friends fight their own wars for themselves. ” Earlier this week, details of the more kinetic option leaked to the Washington Post. It would consist of an addition of at least 3, 000 more U. S. troops, and be matched by an increase in NATO forces. It would also loosen military restrictions in fighting the Taliban, and allow the Pentagon, instead of the White House, to determine how many troops are needed and where. It would bring the current number of U. S. troops in Afghanistan to at least 11, 400. That plan has drawn support from defense hawks on Capitol Hill and the Republican foreign policy establishment in Washington. “We need to break what has been described by our commander there as a ‘stalemate’ which is, after 15 years or so, an unacceptable situation that requires a new strategy, one for victory,” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( ). But the plan has drawn skepticism from those inside the White House who favor winding down the U. S. presence and argue that more troops won’t resolve the war. The Obama administration’s 2009 “surge” sent 30, 000 troops to Afghanistan in order to pressure the Taliban to come to the negotiating table, but once the administration began to draw down the U. S. presence, the gains reversed. The Taliban now control areas with almost a third of the population. A poll last year showed a growing number of Americans who believed Afghanistan was a vital interest, but less than half surveyed supported staying another year. Three U. S. special operators were killed earlier this year in Afghanistan  —   already a fourth of all forces killed last year. Reducing the U. S. presence in Afghanistan could jeopardize gains made in building the Afghan military and air force crucial to giving them an edge over Taliban forces, and could lead to an increase in Afghan troop casualties, which are already steep. But proponents of the less kinetic plan argue that it’s not up to the U. S. to decide what Afghanistan looks like, and that the U. S.’s interests are fighting terrorists and to prevent another   something that can be achieved with fewer forces. “What Afghanistan looks like is not up to America,” the official said. The U. S. has spent a total of $783 billion on the Afghanistan war between fiscal years 2001 to 2016, and the Obama administration had requested $43. 7 billion for fiscal year 2017, according to a Brown University study published in September. There are currently 8, 400 U. S. troops deployed on a   basis to Afghanistan and 4, 600 NATO forces. Trump now must decide what to do, caught between his competing instincts to spend less on overseas wars and empower his top military advisers. His previous public remarks do not provide much insight into how he will decide. At a campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 8, he criticized the amount of spending on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “So we’re on track now to spend  —   listen to this  —   $6 trillion  —   $6 trillion. Could have rebuilt our country twice,” he said. “Meanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of total disrepair. It’s time to rebuild America. ” He also told the London Times in a January 16 interview: “I just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban  —   and you take a look at every, every year it’s more, more, more  …    and you say, you know  —   what’s going on? Afghanistan is, is not going well. ” However, he then said, “Now in all fairness, we haven’t let our people do what they’re supposed to do  …    we haven’t let our military win. ” The White House is not offering any clues into how Trump will decide, although Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday said the U. S.’s “main objective” in Afghanistan is to prevent it from being used as a safe haven for terrorists who attack the homeland, and called it the mission “going forward. ” “That is the main objective. We remain very focused on the defeat of al Qaeda, its associates, as well as the defeat of [Islamic State in Iraq and  ] which is the ISIS affiliate there in Afghanistan. But that is, simply put, what the mission is going forward. ” Trump is expected to make a decision before the next NATO summit in Brussels on May 25. In anticipation of a U. S. troop increase, NATO members have already been considering increasing their troop numbers also. McMaster, who was one of the architects of the Iraq war troop surge and headed an   task force in Afghanistan, is described as the “driving force behind” the more kinetic strategy, according to the Washington Post. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also backs the plan, according to the Post. McMaster is also connected to masterminds of the surge, former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, and retired Army Lt. Gen. Jack Keane. Keane praised McMaster at a dinner Tuesday evening hosted by the Washington Institute. U. S. officials told the Post that increases in troop levels and support to the Afghan government would be “heavily conditioned” on the ability of the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to get rid of ineffective military commanders and reduce corruption. In an ominous sign, an Integrity Watch Afghanistan survey published in December said 71 percent of those surveyed felt corruption had worsened in the past two years. Proponents of the more kinetic plan have modest expectations for the enhanced military effort, according to the Post. The expectations are that Afghan forces would at best be able to “hold the line” this year and begin to recapture some key terrain from the Taliban next year. Their goal is to make “incremental progress” in coming years in order to persuade the Taliban to make concessions that will lead to peace, according to the Post. Not all retired military brass are convinced of the more kinetic option. Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin took to Twitter on Wednesday to express doubt over the plan. “We have been in #Afghanistan for 16yrs and have never had clear objectives  exit strategy.   these, this could cost the #president,” he tweeted. “I do not want #America to spend any more good #soldiers or resources to #Afghanistan pursuing a losing strategy,” he added. “If sent   defined objectives + appropriate ROE, I could be persuaded that this is a viable plan,” he tweeted, referring to rules of engagement. “Right now, I am not convinced. ”'],\n",

       "        'Following the release of footage of a   robot firing handguns at targets, Russian officials have stated that they are not making a “terminator” robot. [The Mirror reports that the robot, known as FEDOR  —   Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research  —   is part of Russias current developments in space exploration. The robot is being developed by Android Technics and the Advanced Research Fund, initially with the aim to aid during rescue operations, however, now the robot is being considered to replace human engineers on the International Space Station.  A video of the robot released recently has made many question the application of these new machines as the android can be seen   pistols and firing them at metal targets in the distance. This caused many people to assume that the robot was some sort of new military hardware designed to replace soldiers in the field.  Russian officials have denied this claim. “We are not creating a Terminator, but artificial intelligence that will be of great practical significance in various fields. ” said Russian Deputy PM Dmitryi Rogozin. FEDOR is currently scheduled to travel into space in 2021 and could act as a permanent replacement to the cosmonauts onboard the ISS. “This thing can work without a space suit, live not only in a crew vehicle, but even outside it. Its name is Fedor. ” said Deputy PM Rogozin. Vladimir Solntsev, general director of Russian   corporation Energia, said: “Our involvement in the   space robot project will bring us to the next level in the development of robotic technologies. ” Director of the TSNIImash laboratory of space robotic Alexander Grebenshchikov said: “Every hour of work of cosmonauts on space walks costs from $2 million to $4 million (USD). ” “The use of robots for routine operations in the future will also spare additional time of the crew for leisure or for the fulfillment of other important tasks. ” said Grebenshchikov.

       "        'The Hill remarks on the high volume of leaks from the Trump White House, to the dismay of President Trump’s allies and the delight of adversarial journalists:[Barely a day goes by without some unusual tale emerging from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Recent examples in a single New York Times story included the assertion that White House aides have held meetings in the dark because they can’t figure out how the lights work and that the president is fond of watching television alone in his bathrobe. Trump took to Twitter to assert that the Times “writes total fiction” about him, while White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the president does not even own a bathrobe. More serious matters have been leaked as well, such as descriptions of Trump’s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump apparently said a U. S.  deal on refugees, agreed to by President Obama, was “the worst deal ever,” and told Turnbull their conversation was “the worst call by far” among several he had held with world leaders that day. “There have been a ton of leaks. It seems that everyone has their own leaking apparatus,” said one of the dismayed Trump allies. “I don’t know how it affects morale, but it is certainly a distraction. They have 55 firehoses aimed at them. Enough of the palace intrigue!”  The Hill reports on speculation the leaks are part of a struggle for supremacy between White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon (formerly of Breitbart News). “Insiders” shot this theory down as an “oversimplification,” arguing that Priebus and Bannon get along much better than the press tends to portray them. Another theory is that knives are coming out for White House press secretary Sean Spicer, whose friends are presumably pushing back to protect him. The Huffington Post proposes that the leaks are coming from veteran officials who are “alarmed by the president’s conduct,” because while some of the leaks are “based on opposition to his policies,” many others “appear motivated by a belief that Trump’s words, deeds, and Tweets pose a genuine threat. ” Actively sabotaging an administration one is supposedly concerned about would be a remarkably selfish and even dangerous strategy, which makes it entirely plausible for Washington lifers. The Huffington Post implies that “widespread leaks and warnings from the national security establishment” over Steve Bannon’s membership in the National Security Council might have played a role in the Yemen raid that went wrong on January 29th. The American people should feel no sense of appreciation or gratitude for those who put American troops in jeopardy and harm our national interests because they want leverage over the president. CNBC cites the advent of an encrypted messaging platform called SecureDrop during the 2016 election cycle, plus the increasing use of various other secure communication systems, as one reason for the high volume of leaks. “It’s hard to name a news organization that has not gotten in touch with us about installing SecureDrop in the past six weeks,” Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said of his organization’s popular tool. He said he thought “general fear that Trump could turn the U. S.’ surveillance on the press” combined with “unrest” in the administration was driving interest in SecureDrop. That’s an interesting contrast with how the press managed only a few days of outrage after President Barack Obama really did turn government surveillance systems on them. “I don’t think it’s impossible that a combination of leaks, and whistleblowers and investigative journalism eventually lead to the downfall of Trump,” Timm added. There might be some manufactured drama in all that talk of encrypted communications. As Randy Evans of the Republican National Committee pointed out to the Huffington Post, leakers aren’t usually caught by wiretapping or email monitoring. The preferred method is the “  test,” in which bits of juicy information are given to suspected leakers, and the boss watches to see which tidbits turn up in the press. President Trump himself has blamed the leaks on “Obama people” left over from the previous administration, in particular citing his leaked phone conversations with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. “It’s a disgrace that they leaked because it’s very much against our country.  It’s a very dangerous thing for this country,” Trump told Fox News.'],\n",

       "        \"Majority of Americans Side With FBI Over Hillary November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nIn a fit of thundering insanity, Hillary Clinton, her media pals and Barack Obama decided to go to war with the FBI. Their pretext was that Hillary Clinton is supposed to have immunity from the FBI before the election. And Comey was being irresponsible and violating protocol, the Hatch Act and the Thou Shalt Not Impede the Electoral Prospects of Democrats mandate. \\nMost Americans have the good sense to think that this is a bunch of rubbish . \\nHillary Clinton and President Obama are outraged about the F.B.I.director James Comey’s decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email, but are the American people? \\nShockingly the American people are not all that outraged about the FBI investigating a corrupt criminal... not nearly as much as the corrupt criminal and her political allies are. \\nIn an online Morning Consult poll of approximately 3,200 registered voters, only 19 percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after Election Day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials. Instead,60 percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to Election Day even if it might affect the election. (Another 21 percent said they don’t know or had no opinion.) \\nIn news that's shocking to the Times, the American people are once again out of step with their left-wing masters. \\nWhen the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was mentioned before the question, partisans differed by almost 50 percentage points in their attitude toward pre-election disclosures, which were endorsed by 83 percent of Republicans but just 34 percent of Democrats — an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt. By contrast, mentioning Mr. Trump’s foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations, which was backed by 57 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans. \\nOne might conclude that Republicans are the more ethical and honest party.\"]],\n",
